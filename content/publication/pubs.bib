  abstract = "Autophagy is a conserved catabolic process in eukaryotes that
              contributes to cell survival in response to multiple stresses and
              is important for organism fitness. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the
              core machinery of autophagy is well defined, but its
              transcriptional regulation is largely unknown. The ATG8
              (autophagy-related 8) protein plays central roles in decorating
              autophagosomes and binding to specific cargo receptors to recruit
              cargo to autophagosomes. We propose that the transcriptional
              control of ATG8 genes is important during the formation of
              autophagosomes and therefore contributes to survival during
              stress. Here, we describe a yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) screen for
              transcription factors (TFs) that regulate ATG8 gene expression in
              Arabidopsis, using the promoters of 4 ATG8 genes. We identified a
              total of 225 TFs from 35 families that bind these promoters. The
              TF-ATG8 promoter interactions revealed a wide array of diverse TF
              families for different promoters, as well as enrichment for
              families of TFs that bound to specific fragments. These TFs are
              not only involved in plant developmental processes but also in
              the response to environmental stresses. TGA9 (TGACG (TGA)
              motif-binding protein 9)/AT1G08320 was confirmed as a positive
              regulator of autophagy. TGA9 overexpression activated autophagy

  abstract = "Dynamic environmental changes such as extreme temperature, water
              scarcity and high salinity affect plant growth, survival, and
              reproduction. Plants have evolved sophisticated regulatory
              mechanisms to adapt to these unfavorable conditions, many of
              which interface with plant hormone signaling pathways. Abiotic
              stresses alter the production and distribution of phytohormones
              that in turn mediate stress responses at least in part through
              hormone- and stress-responsive transcription factors. Among
              these, the APETALA2/ETHYLENE RESPONSIVE FACTOR (AP2/ERF) family
              transcription factors (AP2/ERFs) have emerged as key regulators
              of various stress responses, in which they also respond to
              hormones with improved plant survival during stress conditions.
              Apart from participation in specific stresses, AP2/ERFs are
              involved in a wide range of stress tolerance, enabling them to
              form an interconnected stress regulatory network. Additionally,
              many AP2/ERFs respond to the plant hormones abscisic acid (ABA)
              and ethylene (ET) to help activate ABA and ET dependent and
              independent stress-responsive genes. While some AP2/ERFs are
              implicated in growth and developmental processes mediated by
              gibberellins (GAs), cytokinins (CTK), and brassinosteroids (BRs).
              The involvement of AP2/ERFs in hormone signaling adds the
              complexity of stress regulatory network. In this review, we
              summarize recent studies on AP2/ERF transcription factors in
              hormonal and abiotic stress responses with an emphasis on
              selected family members in Arabidopsis. In addition, we leverage
              publically available Arabidopsis gene networks and transcriptome
              data to investigate AP2/ERF regulatory networks, providing
              context and important clues about the roles of diverse AP2/ERFs

              infection of host plants. Coronatine (COR) is one of the
              phytotoxins produced in bacterial pathogens, such as Pseudomonas
              syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (pst DC3000). COR structurally and
              functionally mimics the active form of the plant hormone jasmonic
              acid (JA), JA-isoleucine (JA-Ile), and can hijack the host
              JA-signaling pathway to achieve host disease susceptibility [1].
              COR utilizes the transcription factor MYC2, a master regulator of
              JA signaling, to activate NAC transcription factors, which
              functions to inhibit accumulation of salicylic acid (SA) and thus
              compromise host immunity [2]. It has been demonstrated that SA
              can antagonize JA signaling through NONEXPRESSOR of
              PATHOGENESIS-RELATED GENE1 (NPR1) [3] and downstream
              transcription factors TGAs [4] and WRKYs [5, 6]. However, the

              receptor kinase FERONIA (FER) functions to inhibit JA and COR
              signaling by phosphorylating and destabilizing MYC2, thereby
              positively regulating immunity. Conversely, the peptide ligand
              RALF23 acts through FER to stabilize MYC2 and elevate JA
              signaling, negatively contributing to plant immunity. Our results
              establish the RALF23-FER-MYC2 signaling module and provide a
              previously unknown mechanism by which host plants utilize FER

              plants have evolved complex control systems that perceive and

              these responses, many of which are mediated by signaling
              molecules such as phytohormones. One such class of molecules

              The molecular determinants of the BR signaling pathway have been

  abstract = "The immutans (im) variegation mutation of Arabidopsis has green-
              and white- sectored leaves due to action of a nuclear recessive
              gene. IM codes for PTOX, a plastoquinol oxidase in plastid
              membranes. Previous studies have revealed that the green and
              white sectors develop into sources (green tissues) and sinks
              (white tissues) early in leaf development. In this report we
              focus on white sectors, and show that their transformation into
              effective sinks involves a sharp reduction in plastid number and
              size. Despite these reductions, cells in the white sectors have
              near-normal amounts of plastid RNA and protein, and surprisingly,
              a marked amplification of chloroplast DNA. The maintenance of
              protein synthesis capacity in the white sectors might poise
              plastids for their development into other plastid types. The
              green and white im sectors have different cell wall compositions:
              whereas cell walls in the green sectors resemble those in wild
              type, cell walls in the white sectors have reduced lignin and
              cellulose microfibrils, as well as alterations in galactomannans
              and the decoration of xyloglucan. These changes promote
              susceptibility to the pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. Enhanced
              susceptibility can also be explained by repressed expression of
              some, but not all, defense genes. We suggest that differences in
              morphology, physiology and biochemistry between the green and
              white sectors is caused by a reprogramming of leaf development
              that is coordinated, in part, by mechanisms of retrograde
              (plastid-to-nucleus) signaling, perhaps mediated by ROS. We
              conclude that variegation mutants offer a novel system to study
              leaf developmental programming, cell wall metabolism and
              host-pathogen interactions.",

              the plasma membrane and other signaling components to regulate
              the BES1/BZR1 family of transcription factors, which modulates
              the expression of thousands of genes. How BES1/BZR1 and their
              interacting proteins function to regulate the large number of
              genes are not completely understood. Here we report that histone
              lysine methyltransferase SDG8, implicated in histone 3 lysine 36
              di- and trimethylation (H3K36me2 and me3), is involved in
              BR-regulated gene expression. BES1 interacts with SDG8, directly
              or indirectly through IWS1, a transcription elongation factor
              involved in BR-regulated gene expression. The knockout mutant
              sdg8 displays a reduced growth phenotype with compromised BR
              responses. Global gene expression studies demonstrated that,
              while BR regulates about 5000 genes in wild-type plants, the
              hormone regulates fewer than 700 genes in sdg8 mutant. In
              addition, more than half of BR-regulated genes are differentially
              affected in sdg8 mutant. A Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
              experiment showed that H3K36me3 is reduced in BR-regulated genes
              in the sdg8 mutant. Based on these results, we propose that SDG8
              plays an essential role in mediating BR-regulated gene
              expression. Our results thus reveal a major mechanism by which

              proplastids in leaf meristems, as well as etioplasts in
              dark-grown seedlings. The mechanisms that govern these
              developmental processes are poorly understood, but entail the
              coordinated expression of nuclear and plastid genes. This
              coordination is achieved, in part, by signals generated in
              response to the metabolic and developmental state of the plastid
              that regulate the transcription of nuclear genes for
              photosynthetic proteins (retrograde signaling). Variegation
              mutants are powerful tools to understand pathways of chloroplast
              biogenesis, and over the years our lab has focused on immutans
              (im) and variegated2 (var2), two nuclear gene-induced
              variegations of Arabidopsis. im and var2 are among the
              best-characterized chloroplast biogenesis mutants, and they
              define the genes for plastid terminal oxidase (PTOX) and the

              proteins, forward and reverse genetic approaches have been used
              to identify second-site suppressors of im and var2 that replace
              or bypass the need for PTOX and AtFtsH2 during chloroplast
              development. In this review, we provide a brief update of im and
              var2 and the functions of PTOX and AtFtsH2. We then summarize
              information about second-site suppressors of im and var2 that
              have been identified to date, and describe how they have provided
