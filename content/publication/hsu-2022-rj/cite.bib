 abstract = {We describe a protocol to perform fast and non-arbitrary quality
control of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) raw data using
scKB and COPILOT. scKB is a wrapper script of kallisto and
bustools for accelerated alignment and transcript count matrix
generation, which runs significantly faster than the popular tool
Cell Ranger. COPILOT then offers non-arbitrary background noise
removal by comparing distributions of low-quality and
high-quality cells. Together, this protocol streamlines the
processing workflow and provides an easy entry for new scRNA-seq
users. For complete details on the use and execution of this
protocol, please refer to Shahan et al. (2022).},
