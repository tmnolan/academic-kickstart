 abstract = {Plant steroid hormones, brassinosteroids (BRs), play important
roles in growth and development. BR signaling controls the
activities of BRASSINOSTERIOD
INSENSITIVE1-EMS-SUPPRESSOR1/BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT1 (BES1/BZR1)
family transcription factors. Besides the role in promoting
growth, BRs are also implicated in plant responses to drought
stress. However, the molecular mechanisms by which BRs regulate
drought response have just begun to be revealed. The functions of
WRKY transcription factors in BR-regulated plant growth have not
been established, although their roles in stress responses are
well documented. Here, we found that three Arabidopsis thaliana
group III WRKY transcription factors, WRKY46, WRKY54, and WRKY70,
are involved in both BR-regulated plant growth and drought
response as the wrky46 wrky54 wrky70 triple mutant has defects in
BR-regulated growth and is more tolerant to drought stress.
RNA-sequencing analysis revealed global roles of WRKY46, WRKY54,
and WRKY70 in promoting BR-mediated gene expression and
inhibiting drought responsive genes. WRKY54 directly interacts
with BES1 to cooperatively regulate the expression of target
genes. In addition, WRKY54 is phosphorylated and destabilized by
GSK3-like kinase BR-INSENSITIVE2, a negative regulator in the BR
pathway. Our results therefore establish WRKY46/54/70 as
important signaling components that are positively involved in
BR-regulated growth and negatively involved in drought responses.},
