 abstract = {We report on the development of an enhanced and robust
microfluidic plant chip-based growth and monitoring system for
high-throughput phenotyping of Arabidopsis thaliana. The system
consists of multiple vertical plant chips, a microfluidic
hormone concentration gradient generator, multiple simple
gravity pumps, and a robotic arm with a stereoscope for plant
imaging. We validate this system by phenotyping the growth of
Arabidopsis plants in medium containing different hormone
concentrations, in a real-time manner. Our results show that
Arabidopsis growth and hormone response in this system closely
replicates growth on standard laboratory petri plates.},
