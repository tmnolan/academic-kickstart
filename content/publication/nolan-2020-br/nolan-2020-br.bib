 abstract = {Brassinosteroids (BRs) are a group of polyhydroxylated plant
steroid hormones that are crucial for many aspects of a plant's
life. BRs were originally characterized for their function in
cell elongation, but it is becoming clear that they play major
roles in plant growth, development, and responses to several
stresses such as extreme temperatures and drought. A BR signaling
pathway from cell surface receptors to central transcription
factors has been well characterized. Here, we summarize recent
progress toward understanding the BR pathway, including BR
perception and the molecular mechanisms of BR signaling. Next, we
discuss the roles of BRs in development and stress responses.
Finally, we show how knowledge of the BR pathway is being applied
to manipulate the growth and stress responses of crops. These
studies highlight the complex regulation of BR signaling,
multiple points of crosstalk between BRs and other hormones or
stress responses, and the finely tuned spatiotemporal regulation
of BR signaling.},
