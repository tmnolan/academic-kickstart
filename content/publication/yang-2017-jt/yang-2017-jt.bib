 abstract = {The plant hormones brassinosteroids (BRs) participate in
light-mediated regulation of plant growth, although the
underlying mechanisms are far from being fully understood. In
addition, the function of the core transcription factor in the BR
signaling pathway, BRI1-EMS-SUPPRESSOR 1 (BES1), largely depends
on its phosphorylation status and its protein stability, but the
regulation of BES1 is not well understood. Here, we report that
SINA of Arabidopsis thaliana (SINATs) specifically interact with
dephosphorylated BES1 and mediate its ubiquitination and
degradation. Our genetic data demonstrated that SINATs inhibit BR
signaling in a BES1-dependent manner. Interestingly, we found
that the protein levels of SINATs were decreased in the dark and
increased in the light, which changed BES1 protein levels
accordingly. Thus, our study not only uncovered a new mechanism
of BES1 degradation but also provides significant insights into
how light conditionally regulates plant growth through
controlling accumulation of different forms of BES1.},
