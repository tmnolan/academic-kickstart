 abstract = {Brassinosteroids (BRs) are steroidal phytohormones that are
essential for plant growth, development and adaptation to
environmental stresses. BRs act in a dose-dependent manner and do
not travel over long distances; hence, BR homeostasis maintenance
is critical for their function. Biosynthesis of bioactive BRs
relies on the cell-to-cell movement of hormone precursors.
However, the mechanism of the short-distance BR transport is
unknown, and its contribution to the control of endogenous BR
levels remains unexplored. Here we demonstrate that plasmodesmata
(PD) mediate the passage of BRs between neighboring cells.
Intracellular BR content, in turn, is capable of modulating PD
permeability to optimize its own mobility, thereby manipulating
BR biosynthesis and signaling. Our work uncovers a thus far
unknown mode of steroid transport in eukaryotes and exposes an
additional layer of BR homeostasis regulation in plants.},
