 abstract = {Brassinosteroids (BRs) play important roles in many growth and
developmental processes. BRs signal to regulate
BR-INSENSITIVE1-ETHYL METHANESULFONATE-SUPPRESSOR1 (BES1) and
BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT1 (BZR1) transcription factors (TFs),
which, in turn, regulate several hundreds of transcription
factors (termed BES1/BZR1-targeted TFs or BTFs) and thousands of
genes to mediate various BR responses. Chromatin
Immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing
(ChIP-seq) with BES1/BZR1 and BTFs is an important approach to
identify BR target genes. In combination with RNA-sequencing
experiments, these genomic methods have become powerful tools to
detect BR target genes and reveal transcriptional networks
underlying BR-regulated processes.},
