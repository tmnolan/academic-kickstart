 abstract = {Bacterial pathogens use effectors and phytotoxins to facilitate
infection of host plants. Coronatine (COR) is one of the
phytotoxins produced in bacterial pathogens, such as Pseudomonas
syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (pst DC3000). COR structurally and
functionally mimics the active form of the plant hormone jasmonic
acid (JA), JA-isoleucine (JA-Ile), and can hijack the host
JA-signaling pathway to achieve host disease susceptibility [1].
COR utilizes the transcription factor MYC2, a master regulator of
JA signaling, to activate NAC transcription factors, which
functions to inhibit accumulation of salicylic acid (SA) and thus
compromise host immunity [2]. It has been demonstrated that SA
can antagonize JA signaling through NONEXPRESSOR of
PATHOGENESIS-RELATED GENE1 (NPR1) [3] and downstream
transcription factors TGAs [4] and WRKYs [5, 6]. However, the
detailed mechanism by which host plants counteract COR-mediated
susceptibility is largely unknown. Here, we show that the
receptor kinase FERONIA (FER) functions to inhibit JA and COR
signaling by phosphorylating and destabilizing MYC2, thereby
positively regulating immunity. Conversely, the peptide ligand
RALF23 acts through FER to stabilize MYC2 and elevate JA
signaling, negatively contributing to plant immunity. Our results
establish the RALF23-FER-MYC2 signaling module and provide a
previously unknown mechanism by which host plants utilize FER
signaling to counteract COR-mediated host disease susceptibility.},
