abstract: "Brassinosteroids (BRs) are plant steroid hormones that regulate cell division and stress response. Here we use a systems biology approach to integrate multi-omic datasets and unravel the molecular signaling events of BR response in Arabidopsis. We profile the levels of 26,669 transcripts, 9,533 protein groups, and 26,617 phosphorylation sites from Arabidopsis seedlings treated with brassinolide (BL) for six different lengths of time. We then construct a network inference pipeline called Spatiotemporal Clustering and Inference of Omics Networks (SC-ION) to integrate these data. We use our network predictions to identify putative phosphorylation sites on BES1 and experimentally validate their importance. Additionally, we identify BRONTOSAURUS (BRON) as a transcription factor that regulates cell division, and we show that BRON expression is modulated by BR-responsive kinases and transcription factors. This work demonstrates the power of integrative network analysis applied to multi-omic data and provides fundamental insights into the molecular signaling events occurring during BR response."
