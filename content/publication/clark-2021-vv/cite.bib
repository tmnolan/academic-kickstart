 abstract = {Brassinosteroids (BRs) are plant steroid hormones that regulate
cell division and stress response. Here we use a systems biology
approach to integrate multi-omic datasets and unravel the
molecular signaling events of BR response in Arabidopsis. We
profile the levels of 26,669 transcripts, 9,533 protein groups,
and 26,617 phosphorylation sites from Arabidopsis seedlings
treated with brassinolide (BL) for six different lengths of time.
We then construct a network inference pipeline called
Spatiotemporal Clustering and Inference of Omics Networks
(SC-ION) to integrate these data. We use our network predictions
to identify putative phosphorylation sites on BES1 and
experimentally validate their importance. Additionally, we
identify BRONTOSAURUS (BRON) as a transcription factor that
regulates cell division, and we show that BRON expression is
modulated by BR-responsive kinases and transcription factors.
This work demonstrates the power of integrative network analysis
applied to multi-omic data and provides fundamental insights into
the molecular signaling events occurring during BR response.},
