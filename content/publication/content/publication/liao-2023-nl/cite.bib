 abstract = {Macroautophagy/autophagy is a conserved recycling process that
maintains cellular homeostasis during environmental stress.
Autophagy is negatively regulated by TOR (target of rapamycin), a
nutrient-regulated protein kinase that in plants is activated by
several phytohormones, leading to increased growth. However, the
detailed molecular mechanisms by which TOR integrates autophagy
and hormone signaling are poorly understood. Here, we show that
TOR modulates brassinosteroid (BR)-regulated plant growth and
stress-response pathways. Active TOR was required for full
BR-mediated growth in Arabidopsis thaliana. Autophagy was
constitutively up-regulated upon blocking BR biosynthesis or
signaling, and down-regulated by increasing the activity of the
BR pathway. BIN2 (brassinosteroid-insensitive 2) kinase, a
GSK3-like kinase functioning as a negative regulator in BR
signaling, directly phosphorylated RAPTOR1B
(regulatory-associated protein of TOR 1B), a substrate-recruiting
subunit in the TOR complex, at a conserved serine residue within
a typical BIN2 phosphorylation motif. Mutation of RAPTOR1B serine
916 to alanine, to block phosphorylation by BIN2, repressed
autophagy and increased phosphorylation of the TOR substrate
ATG13a (autophagy-related protein 13a). By contrast, this
mutation had only a limited effect on growth. We present a model
in which RAPTOR1B is phosphorylated and inhibited by BIN2 when
BRs are absent, activating the autophagy pathway. When BRs signal
and inhibit BIN2, RAPTOR1B is thus less inhibited by BIN2
phosphorylation. This leads to increased TOR activity and ATG13a
phosphorylation, and decreased autophagy activity. Our studies
define a new mechanism by which coordination between BR and TOR
signaling pathways helps to maintain the balance between plant
growth and stress responses.},
