 abstract = {Brassinosteroids (BRs) and Target of Rapamycin Complex (TORC)
are two major actors coordinating plant growth and stress
responses. Brassinosteroids function through a signaling pathway
to extensively regulate gene expression and TORC is known to
regulate translation and autophagy. Recent studies have revealed
connections between these two pathways, but a system-wide view
of their interplay is still missing. We quantified the level of
23 975 transcripts, 11 183 proteins, and 27 887 phosphorylation
sites in wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana and in mutants with
altered levels of either BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 2 (BIN2) or
REGULATORY ASSOCIATED PROTEIN OF TOR 1B (RAPTOR1B), two key
players in BR and TORC signaling, respectively. We found that
perturbation of BIN2 or RAPTOR1B levels affects a common set of
gene-products involved in growth and stress responses.
Furthermore, we used the multi-omic data to reconstruct an
integrated signaling network. We screened 41 candidate genes
identified from the reconstructed network and found that loss of
function mutants of many of these proteins led to an altered BR
response and/or modulated autophagy activity. Altogether, these
results establish a predictive network that defines different
layers of molecular interactions between BR- or TORC-regulated
growth and autophagy.},
