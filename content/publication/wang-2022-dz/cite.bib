 abstract = {FERONIA (FER) receptor kinase plays versatile roles in plant
growth and development, biotic and abiotic stress responses, and
reproduction. Autophagy is a conserved cellular recycling process
that is critical for balancing plant growth and stress responses.
Target of Rapamycin (TOR) has been shown to be a master regulator
of autophagy. Our previous multi-omics analysis with
loss-of-function fer-4 mutant implicated that FER functions in
the autophagy pathway. We further demonstrated here that the
fer-4 mutant displayed constitutive autophagy, and FER is
required for TOR kinase activity measured by S6K1 phosphorylation
and by root growth inhibition assay to TOR kinase inhibitor
AZD8055. Taken together, our study provides a previously unknown
mechanism by which FER functions through TOR to negatively
regulate autophagy.},
