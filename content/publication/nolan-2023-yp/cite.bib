 abstract = {Brassinosteroids are plant steroid hormones that regulate diverse
processes, such as cell division and cell elongation, through
gene regulatory networks that vary in space and time. By using
time series single-cell RNA sequencing to profile
brassinosteroid-responsive gene expression specific to different
cell types and developmental stages of the Arabidopsis root, we
identified the elongating cortex as a site where brassinosteroids
trigger a shift from proliferation to elongation associated with
increased expression of cell wall--related genes. Our analysis
revealed HOMEOBOX FROM ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA 7 (HAT7) and
GT-2-LIKE 1 (GTL1) as brassinosteroid-responsive transcription
factors that regulate cortex cell elongation. These results
establish the cortex as a site of brassinosteroid-mediated growth
and unveil a brassinosteroid signaling network regulating the
transition from proliferation to elongation, which illuminates
aspects of spatiotemporal hormone responses. Hormones known as
brassinosteroids affect many aspects of plant growth and
development. Nolan et al. applied single-cell RNA sequencing to
the roots of the small mustard plant Arabidopsis to study how
brassinosteroids control the developmental shift that cells
undergo as they cease proliferation and begin to elongate. The
gene network involved drove altered expression of genes involved
in cell wall biogenesis and organization. Two particular
transcription factors were identified as regulators of cell
elongation. ---PJH Single-cell RNA sequencing identifies the
