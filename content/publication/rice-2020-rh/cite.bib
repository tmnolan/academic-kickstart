 abstract = {The societal challenges posed by a growing human population and
climate change necessitate technical advances in plant science.
Plant research makes vital contributions to society by advancing
technologies that improve agricultural food production,
biological energy capture and conversion, and human health.
However, the plant biology community lacks a comprehensive
understanding of molecular machinery, including their locations
within cells, distributions and variations among different cell
types, and real-time dynamics. Fortunately, rapid advances in
molecular methods, imaging, proteomics, and metabolomics made in
the last decade afford unprecedented opportunities to develop a
molecular-level map of plant cells with high temporal and spatial
resolution. The Plant Cell Atlas (PCA) initiative aims to
generate a resource that will provide fresh insight into poorly
understood aspects of plant cell structure and organization and
enable the discovery of new cellular compartments and features.
The PCA will be a community resource (www.plantcellatlas.org/)
that describes the state of various plant cell types and
integrates high-resolution spatio-temporal information of nucleic
acids, proteins, and metabolites within plant cells. This first
PCA initiative workshop convened scientists passionate about
developing a comprehensive PCA to brainstorm about the state of
the field, recent advances, the development of tools, and the
future directions of this initiative. The workshop featured
invited talks to share initial data, along with broader ideas for
the PCA. Additionally, breakout sessions were organized around
topics including the conceptual goals of the PCA, technical
challenges, and community wants and needs. These activities
connected scientists with diverse expertise and sparked important
discussions about how to leverage and extend leading-edge
technologies and develop new techniques. A major outcome of the
workshop was that the community wishes to redefine concepts of
plant cell types and tissues quantitatively. A long-term goal is
to delineate all molecules within the cell at high
spatio-temporal resolution, obtain information about interacting
molecular networks, and identify the contribution of these
networks to development of the organism as a whole. As a first
step, we wish to create comprehensive cellular and subcellular
biomolecular maps of transcripts, proteins, and metabolites,
track the dynamic interactions of these molecules intra- and
intercellularly, discern complete states and transitions of
specialized cell types, and integrate these disparate data points
to generate testable models of cellular function. Ultimately, the
PCA initiative will have a substantial positive impact by
empowering a broad, diverse group of scientists to forge exciting
paths in the field of plant science, facilitating connections
with interested stakeholders beyond the scientific community, and
enabling new agricultural technologies for a sustainable future.},
