 abstract = {Brassinosteroids (BR) and Target of Rapamycin Complex (TORC) are
two major processes coordinating plant growth and stress
responses. BRs function through a signaling pathway to
extensively regulate gene expression and TORC is known to
regulate translation and autophagy. Recent studies revealed that
these two pathways crosstalk, but a system-wide view of their
interplay is still missing. Thus, we performed transcriptome,
proteome, and phosphoproteome profiling of Arabidopsis mutants
with altered levels of either BIN2 or RAPTOR1B, two key players
in BR and TORC signaling, respectively. We found that
perturbation of BIN2 or RAPTOR1B levels affects a common set of
gene-products involved in growth and stress responses.
Additionally, we performed Multiplexed Assay for Kinase
Specificity (MAKS), which provided a system-wide view of direct
BIN2 substrates. Furthermore, phosphoproteomic data was used to
reconstruct a kinase-signaling network and to identify novel
proteins dependent on BR and/or TORC signaling pathways. Loss of
function mutants of many of these proteins led to an altered BR
response and/or modulated autophagy activity. Altogether, these
results provide genome-wide evidence for crosstalk between BR and
TORC signaling and established a kinase signaling network that
defines the molecular mechanisms of BR and TORC interactions in
the regulation of plant growth/stress balance. ### Competing
