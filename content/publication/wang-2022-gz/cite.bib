 abstract = {The receptor kinase FERONIA (FER) is a versatile regulator of
plant growth and development, biotic and abiotic stress
responses, and reproduction. To gain new insights into the
molecular interplay of these processes and to identify new FER
functions, we carried out quantitative transcriptome, proteome,
and phosphoproteome profiling of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis
thaliana) wild-type and fer-4 loss-of-function mutant plants.
Gene ontology terms for phytohormone signaling, abiotic stress,
and biotic stress were significantly enriched among
differentially expressed transcripts, differentially abundant
proteins, and/or misphosphorylated proteins, in agreement with
the known roles for FER in these processes. Analysis of
multiomics data and subsequent experimental evidence revealed
previously unknown functions for FER in endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) body formation and glucosinolate biosynthesis. FER functions
through the transcription factor NAI1 to mediate ER body
formation. FER also negatively regulates indole glucosinolate
biosynthesis, partially through NAI1. Furthermore, we found that
a group of abscisic acid (ABA)-induced transcription factors is
hypophosphorylated in the fer-4 mutant and demonstrated that FER
acts through the transcription factor ABA INSENSITIVE5 (ABI5) to
negatively regulate the ABA response during cotyledon greening.
Our integrated omics study therefore reveals novel functions for
FER and provides new insights into the underlying mechanisms of
FER function.},
