 abstract = {Plants encounter a variety of stresses and must fine-tune their
growth and stress-response programs to best suit their
environment. BES1 functions as a master regulator in the
brassinosteroid (BR) pathway that promotes plant growth. Here, we
show that BES1 interacts with the ubiquitin receptor protein DSK2
and is targeted to the autophagy pathway during stress via the
interaction of DSK2 with ATG8, a ubiquitin-like protein directing
autophagosome formation and cargo recruitment. Additionally, DSK2
is phosphorylated by the GSK3-like kinase BIN2, a negative
regulator in the BR pathway. BIN2 phosphorylation of DSK2
flanking its ATG8 interacting motifs (AIMs) promotes DSK2-ATG8
interaction, thereby targeting BES1 for degradation. Accordingly,
loss-of-function dsk2 mutants accumulate BES1, have altered
global gene expression profiles, and have compromised stress
responses. Our results thus reveal that plants coordinate growth
and stress responses by integrating BR and autophagy pathways and
identify the molecular basis of this crosstalk.},
