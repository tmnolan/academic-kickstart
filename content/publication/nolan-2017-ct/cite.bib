 abstract = {Plants are faced with a barrage of stresses in their environment
and must constantly balance their growth and survival. As such,
plants have evolved complex control systems that perceive and
respond to external and internal stimuli in order to optimize
these responses, many of which are mediated by signaling
molecules such as phytohormones. One such class of molecules
called Brassinosteroids (BRs) are an important group of plant
steroid hormones involved in numerous aspects of plant life
including growth, development and response to various stresses.
The molecular determinants of the BR signaling pathway have been
extensively defined, starting with the membrane-localized
receptor BRI1 and co-receptor BAK1 and ultimately culminating in
the activation of BES1/BZR1 family transcription factors, which
direct a transcriptional network controlling the expression of
thousands of genes enabling BRs to influence growth and stress
programs. Here, we highlight recent progress in understanding the
relationship between the BR pathway and plant stress responses
and provide an integrated view of the mechanisms mediating
cross-talk between BR and stress signaling.},
