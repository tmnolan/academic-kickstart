 abstract = {Brassinosteroids (BRs) regulate plant growth and stress responses
via the BES1/BZR1 family of transcription factors, which regulate
the expression of thousands of downstream genes. BRs are involved
in the response to drought, however the mechanistic understanding
of interactions between BR signalling and drought response
remains to be established. Here we show that transcription factor
RD26 mediates crosstalk between drought and BR signalling. When
overexpressed, BES1 target gene RD26 can inhibit BR-regulated
growth. Global gene expression studies suggest that RD26 can act
antagonistically to BR to regulate the expression of a subset of
BES1-regulated genes, thereby inhibiting BR function. We show
that RD26 can interact with BES1 protein and antagonize BES1
transcriptional activity on BR-regulated genes and that BR
signalling can also repress expression of RD26 and its homologues
and inhibit drought responses. Our results thus reveal a
mechanism coordinating plant growth and drought tolerance.},
