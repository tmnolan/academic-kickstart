 abstract = {In all multicellular organisms, transcriptional networks
orchestrate organ development. The Arabidopsis root, with its
simple structure and indeterminate growth, is an ideal model for
investigating the spatiotemporal transcriptional signatures
underlying developmental trajectories. To map gene expression
dynamics across root cell types and developmental time, we built
a comprehensive, organ-scale atlas at single-cell resolution. In
addition to estimating developmental progressions in pseudotime,
we employed the mathematical concept of optimal transport to
infer developmental trajectories and identify their underlying
regulators. To demonstrate the utility of the atlas to interpret
new datasets, we profiled mutants for two key transcriptional
regulators at single-cell resolution, shortroot and scarecrow. We
report transcriptomic and in vivo evidence for tissue
trans-differentiation underlying a mixed cell identity phenotype
in scarecrow. Our results support the atlas as a rich community
resource for unraveling the transcriptional programs that specify
and maintain cell identity to regulate spatiotemporal organ
development.},
