 abstract = {Brassinosteroids (BRs) regulate plant growth, development and
stress responses by activating the core transcription factor
BRI1-EMS-SUPPRESSOR1 (BES1), whose degradation occurs through the
proteasome and autophagy pathways. The E3 ubiquitin ligase(s)
that modify BES1 for autophagy-mediated degradation remain to be
fully defined. Here, we identified an F-box family E3 ubiquitin
ligase named BES1-ASSOCIATED F-BOX1 (BAF1) in Arabidopsis
thaliana. BAF1 interacts with BES1 and mediates its
ubiquitination and degradation. Our genetic data demonstrated
that BAF1 inhibits BR signaling in a BES1-dependent manner.
Moreover, BAF1 targets BES1 for autophagic degradation in a
selective manner. BAF1-triggered selective autophagy of BES1
depends on the ubiquitin binding receptor DOMINANT SUPPRESSOR OF
KAR2 (DSK2). Sucrose starvation-induced selective autophagy of
BES1, but not bulk autophagy, was significantly compromised in
baf1 mutant and BAF1-$Δ$F (BAF1 F-box decoy) overexpression
plants, but clearly increased by BAF1 overexpression. The baf1
and BAF1-$Δ$F overexpression plants had increased
BR-regulated growth but were sensitive to long-term sucrose
starvation, while BAF1 overexpression plants had decreased
BR-regulated growth but were highly tolerant of sucrose
starvation. Our results not only established BAF1 as an E3
ubiquitin ligase that targets BES1 for degradation through
selective autophagy pathway, but also revealed a mechanism for
plants to reduce growth during sucrose starvation.},
