 abstract = {Dynamic environmental changes such as extreme temperature, water
scarcity and high salinity affect plant growth, survival, and
reproduction. Plants have evolved sophisticated regulatory
mechanisms to adapt to these unfavorable conditions, many of
which interface with plant hormone signaling pathways. Abiotic
stresses alter the production and distribution of phytohormones
that in turn mediate stress responses at least in part through
hormone- and stress-responsive transcription factors. Among
these, the APETALA2/ETHYLENE RESPONSIVE FACTOR (AP2/ERF) family
transcription factors (AP2/ERFs) have emerged as key regulators
of various stress responses, in which they also respond to
hormones with improved plant survival during stress conditions.
Apart from participation in specific stresses, AP2/ERFs are
involved in a wide range of stress tolerance, enabling them to
form an interconnected stress regulatory network. Additionally,
many AP2/ERFs respond to the plant hormones abscisic acid (ABA)
and ethylene (ET) to help activate ABA and ET dependent and
independent stress-responsive genes. While some AP2/ERFs are
implicated in growth and developmental processes mediated by
gibberellins (GAs), cytokinins (CTK), and brassinosteroids (BRs).
The involvement of AP2/ERFs in hormone signaling adds the
complexity of stress regulatory network. In this review, we
summarize recent studies on AP2/ERF transcription factors in
hormonal and abiotic stress responses with an emphasis on
selected family members in Arabidopsis. In addition, we leverage
publically available Arabidopsis gene networks and transcriptome
data to investigate AP2/ERF regulatory networks, providing
context and important clues about the roles of diverse AP2/ERFs
in controlling hormone and stress responses.},
