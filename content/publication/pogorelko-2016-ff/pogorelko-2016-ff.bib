 abstract = {The immutans (im) variegation mutation of Arabidopsis has green-
and white- sectored leaves due to action of a nuclear recessive
gene. IM codes for PTOX, a plastoquinol oxidase in plastid
membranes. Previous studies have revealed that the green and
white sectors develop into sources (green tissues) and sinks
(white tissues) early in leaf development. In this report we
focus on white sectors, and show that their transformation into
effective sinks involves a sharp reduction in plastid number and
size. Despite these reductions, cells in the white sectors have
near-normal amounts of plastid RNA and protein, and surprisingly,
a marked amplification of chloroplast DNA. The maintenance of
protein synthesis capacity in the white sectors might poise
plastids for their development into other plastid types. The
green and white im sectors have different cell wall compositions:
whereas cell walls in the green sectors resemble those in wild
type, cell walls in the white sectors have reduced lignin and
cellulose microfibrils, as well as alterations in galactomannans
and the decoration of xyloglucan. These changes promote
susceptibility to the pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. Enhanced
susceptibility can also be explained by repressed expression of
some, but not all, defense genes. We suggest that differences in
morphology, physiology and biochemistry between the green and
white sectors is caused by a reprogramming of leaf development
that is coordinated, in part, by mechanisms of retrograde
(plastid-to-nucleus) signaling, perhaps mediated by ROS. We
conclude that variegation mutants offer a novel system to study
leaf developmental programming, cell wall metabolism and
host-pathogen interactions.},
