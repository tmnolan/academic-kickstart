  abstract = "Brassinosteroids (BRs) are a group of polyhydroxylated plant
              steroid hormones crucial for many aspects of plant life. BRs were
              originally characterized for their function in cell elongation,
              but it is becoming clear that they play major roles in plant
              growth, development and responses to several stresses such as
              temperature and drought. A BR signaling pathway from cell surface
              receptors to central transcription factors has been well
              characterized. Here we summarize recent progress towards
              understanding the BR pathway including BR perception and the
              molecular mechanisms of BR signaling. Next, we discuss the roles
              of BRs in development and stress responses. Finally, we show how
              knowledge of the BR pathway is being applied to manipulate the
              growth and stress responses in crops. These studies highlight the
              complex regulation of BR signaling, multiple points of crosstalk
              between BRs and other hormones or stress responses, and finely
              tuned spatiotemporal regulation of BR signaling.",
