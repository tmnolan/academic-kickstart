 abstract = {The plant steroid hormones, brassinosteroids (BRs), play
important roles in plant growth, development, and responses to
environmental stresses. BRs signal through receptors localized to
the plasma membrane and other signaling components to regulate
the BES1/BZR1 family of transcription factors, which modulates
the expression of thousands of genes. How BES1/BZR1 and their
interacting proteins function to regulate the large number of
genes are not completely understood. Here we report that histone
lysine methyltransferase SDG8, implicated in histone 3 lysine 36
di- and trimethylation (H3K36me2 and me3), is involved in
BR-regulated gene expression. BES1 interacts with SDG8, directly
or indirectly through IWS1, a transcription elongation factor
involved in BR-regulated gene expression. The knockout mutant
sdg8 displays a reduced growth phenotype with compromised BR
responses. Global gene expression studies demonstrated that,
while BR regulates about 5000 genes in wild-type plants, the
hormone regulates fewer than 700 genes in sdg8 mutant. In
addition, more than half of BR-regulated genes are differentially
affected in sdg8 mutant. A Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
experiment showed that H3K36me3 is reduced in BR-regulated genes
in the sdg8 mutant. Based on these results, we propose that SDG8
plays an essential role in mediating BR-regulated gene
expression. Our results thus reveal a major mechanism by which
histone modifications dictate hormonal regulation of gene
expression.},
