 abstract = {Brassinosteroids (BRs) are a group of plant steroid hormones
involved in regulating growth, development, and stress responses.
Many components of the BR pathway have previously been identified
and characterized. However, BR phenotyping experiments are
typically performed in a low-throughput manner, such as on Petri
plates. Additionally, the BR pathway affects drought responses,
but drought experiments are time consuming and difficult to
control. To mitigate these issues and increase throughput, we
developed the Robotic Assay for Drought (RoAD) system to perform
BR and drought response experiments in soil-grown Arabidopsis
plants. RoAD is equipped with a robotic arm, a rover, a bench
scale, a precisely controlled watering system, an RGB camera, and
a laser profilometer. It performs daily weighing, watering, and
imaging tasks and is capable of administering BR response assays
by watering plants with Propiconazole (PCZ), a BR biosynthesis
inhibitor. We developed image processing algorithms for both
plant segmentation and phenotypic trait extraction to accurately
measure traits including plant area, plant volume, leaf length,
and leaf width. We then applied machine learning algorithms that
utilize the extracted phenotypic parameters to identify
image-derived traits that can distinguish control,
drought-treated, and PCZ-treated plants. We carried out PCZ and
drought experiments on a set of BR mutants and Arabidopsis
accessions with altered BR responses. Finally, we extended the
RoAD assays to perform BR response assays using PCZ in Zea mays
(maize) plants. This study establishes an automated and
non-invasive robotic imaging system as a tool to accurately
measure morphological and growth-related traits of Arabidopsis
and maize plants in 3D, providing insights into the BR-mediated
control of plant growth and stress responses.},
