 abstract = {Autophagy is a conserved catabolic process in eukaryotes that
contributes to cell survival in response to multiple stresses and
is important for organism fitness. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the
core machinery of autophagy is well defined, but its
transcriptional regulation is largely unknown. The ATG8
(autophagy-related 8) protein plays central roles in decorating
autophagosomes and binding to specific cargo receptors to recruit
cargo to autophagosomes. We propose that the transcriptional
control of ATG8 genes is important during the formation of
autophagosomes and therefore contributes to survival during
stress. Here, we describe a yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) screen for
transcription factors (TFs) that regulate ATG8 gene expression in
Arabidopsis, using the promoters of 4 ATG8 genes. We identified a
total of 225 TFs from 35 families that bind these promoters. The
TF-ATG8 promoter interactions revealed a wide array of diverse TF
families for different promoters, as well as enrichment for
families of TFs that bound to specific fragments. These TFs are
not only involved in plant developmental processes but also in
the response to environmental stresses. TGA9 (TGACG (TGA)
motif-binding protein 9)/AT1G08320 was confirmed as a positive
regulator of autophagy. TGA9 overexpression activated autophagy
under both control and stress conditions and transcriptionally
up-regulated expression of ATG8B, ATG8E and additional ATG genes
via binding to their promoters. Our results provide a
comprehensive resource of TFs that regulate ATG8 gene expression
and lay a foundation for understanding the transcriptional
regulation of plant autophagy. Abbreviations: ABRC: Arabidopsis
