abstract = "Brassinosteroids (BRs) are plant steroid hormones that are known to regulate cell division and stress response. We used a systems biology approach to integrate multi-omic datasets and unravel the molecular signaling events of BR response in Arabidopsis . We profiled the levels of 32,549 transcripts, 9,035 protein groups, and 26,950 phosphorylation sites from Arabidopsis seedlings treated with brassinolide (BL, most active BR) for six different lengths of time. We then constructed a network inference pipeline called Spatiotemporal Clustering and Inference of Omics Networks (SC-ION) that was able to integrate these multi-omic data into one, cohesive regulatory network. Our network illustrates the signaling cascade of BR response, starting with kinase-substrate phosphorylation and ending with transcriptional regulation. We used our network predictions to identify putative, relevant phosphorylation sites on the TF BRI1-EMS-SUPPRESSOR 1 (BES1); the importance of which we experimentally validated. Additionally, we identified an uncharacterized TF, which we named BRONTOSAURUS (BRON), that regulates cell division. Further, we show that bron mutant roots are hypersensitive to BL. Together, this work demonstrates the power of integrative network analysis applied to multiomic data and provides fundamental insights into the molecular signaling events occurring during BR response. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest."
