 abstract = {Brassinosteroids (BRs) are plant steroid hormones that are known
to regulate cell division and stress response. We used a systems
biology approach to integrate multi-omic datasets and unravel the
molecular signaling events of BR response in Arabidopsis . We
profiled the levels of 32,549 transcripts, 9,035 protein groups,
and 26,950 phosphorylation sites from Arabidopsis seedlings
treated with brassinolide (BL, most active BR) for six different
lengths of time. We then constructed a network inference pipeline
called Spatiotemporal Clustering and Inference of Omics Networks
(SC-ION) that was able to integrate these multi-omic data into
one, cohesive regulatory network. Our network illustrates the
signaling cascade of BR response, starting with kinase-substrate
phosphorylation and ending with transcriptional regulation. We
used our network predictions to identify putative, relevant
phosphorylation sites on the TF BRI1-EMS-SUPPRESSOR 1 (BES1); the
importance of which we experimentally validated. Additionally, we
identified an uncharacterized TF, which we named BRONTOSAURUS
(BRON), that regulates cell division. Further, we show that bron
mutant roots are hypersensitive to BL. Together, this work
demonstrates the power of integrative network analysis applied to
multiomic data and provides fundamental insights into the
molecular signaling events occurring during BR response. ###
