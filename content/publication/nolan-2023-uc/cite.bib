 abstract = {Single-cell genomics technologies are ushering in a new research
era. In this review, we summarize the benefits and current
challenges of using these technologies to probe the
transcriptional regulation of plant development. In addition to
profiling cells at a single snapshot in time, researchers have
recently produced time-resolved datasets to map cell responses to
stimuli. Live-imaging and spatial transcriptomic techniques are
rapidly being adopted to link a cell's transcriptional profile
with its spatial location within a tissue. Combining these
technologies is a powerful spatiotemporal approach to investigate
cell plasticity and developmental responses that contribute to
plant resilience. Although there are hurdles to overcome, we
conclude by discussing how single-cell genomics is poised to
address developmental questions in the coming years.},
