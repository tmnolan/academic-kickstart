 abstract = {Chloroplast biogenesis is an essential light-dependent process
involving the differentiation of photosynthetically competent
chloroplasts from precursors that include undifferentiated
proplastids in leaf meristems, as well as etioplasts in
dark-grown seedlings. The mechanisms that govern these
developmental processes are poorly understood, but entail the
coordinated expression of nuclear and plastid genes. This
coordination is achieved, in part, by signals generated in
response to the metabolic and developmental state of the plastid
that regulate the transcription of nuclear genes for
photosynthetic proteins (retrograde signaling). Variegation
mutants are powerful tools to understand pathways of chloroplast
biogenesis, and over the years our lab has focused on immutans
(im) and variegated2 (var2), two nuclear gene-induced
variegations of Arabidopsis. im and var2 are among the
best-characterized chloroplast biogenesis mutants, and they
define the genes for plastid terminal oxidase (PTOX) and the
AtFtsH2 subunit of the thylakoid FtsH metalloprotease complex,
respectively. To gain insight into the function of these
proteins, forward and reverse genetic approaches have been used
to identify second-site suppressors of im and var2 that replace
or bypass the need for PTOX and AtFtsH2 during chloroplast
development. In this review, we provide a brief update of im and
var2 and the functions of PTOX and AtFtsH2. We then summarize
information about second-site suppressors of im and var2 that
have been identified to date, and describe how they have provided
insight into mechanisms of photosynthesis and pathways of
chloroplast development.},
