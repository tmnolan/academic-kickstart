  abstract = "Brassinosteroids (BR) and Target of Rapamycin Complex (TORC) are
              two major processes coordinating plant growth and stress
              responses. BRs function through a signaling pathway to
              extensively regulate gene expression and TORC is known to
              regulate translation and autophagy. Recent studies revealed that
              these two pathways crosstalk, but a system-wide view of their
              interplay is still missing. Thus, we performed transcriptome,
              proteome, and phosphoproteome profiling of Arabidopsis mutants
              with altered levels of either BIN2 or RAPTOR1B, two key players
              in BR and TORC signaling, respectively. We found that
              perturbation of BIN2 or RAPTOR1B levels affects a common set of
              gene-products involved in growth and stress responses.
              Additionally, we performed Multiplexed Assay for Kinase
              Specificity (MAKS), which provided a system-wide view of direct
              BIN2 substrates. Furthermore, phosphoproteomic data was used to
              reconstruct a kinase-signaling network and to identify novel
              proteins dependent on BR and/or TORC signaling pathways. Loss of
              function mutants of many of these proteins led to an altered BR
              response and/or modulated autophagy activity. Altogether, these
              results provide genome-wide evidence for crosstalk between BR and
              TORC signaling and established a kinase signaling network that
              defines the molecular mechanisms of BR and TORC interactions in
              the regulation of plant growth/stress balance. \#\#\# Competing

              technologies that improve agricultural food production,
              biological energy capture and conversion, and human health.
              However, the plant biology community lacks a comprehensive
              understanding of molecular machinery, including their locations
              within cells, distributions and variations among different cell
              types, and real-time dynamics. Fortunately, rapid advances in
              molecular methods, imaging, proteomics, and metabolomics made in
              the last decade afford unprecedented opportunities to develop a
              molecular-level map of plant cells with high temporal and spatial
              resolution. The Plant Cell Atlas (PCA) initiative aims to
              generate a resource that will provide fresh insight into poorly
              understood aspects of plant cell structure and organization and
              enable the discovery of new cellular compartments and features.
              The PCA will be a community resource (www.plantcellatlas.org/)
              that describes the state of various plant cell types and
              integrates high-resolution spatio-temporal information of nucleic
              acids, proteins, and metabolites within plant cells. This first
              PCA initiative workshop convened scientists passionate about
              developing a comprehensive PCA to brainstorm about the state of
              the field, recent advances, the development of tools, and the
              future directions of this initiative. The workshop featured
              invited talks to share initial data, along with broader ideas for
              the PCA. Additionally, breakout sessions were organized around
              topics including the conceptual goals of the PCA, technical
              challenges, and community wants and needs. These activities
              connected scientists with diverse expertise and sparked important
              discussions about how to leverage and extend leading-edge
              technologies and develop new techniques. A major outcome of the
              workshop was that the community wishes to redefine concepts of
              plant cell types and tissues quantitatively. A long-term goal is
              to delineate all molecules within the cell at high
              spatio-temporal resolution, obtain information about interacting
              molecular networks, and identify the contribution of these
              networks to development of the organism as a whole. As a first
              step, we wish to create comprehensive cellular and subcellular
              biomolecular maps of transcripts, proteins, and metabolites,
              track the dynamic interactions of these molecules intra- and
              intercellularly, discern complete states and transitions of
              specialized cell types, and integrate these disparate data points
              to generate testable models of cellular function. Ultimately, the
              PCA initiative will have a substantial positive impact by

              typically performed on petri plates and/or in a low-throughput

              drought responses, but drought experiments are time-consuming and
              difficult to control. Thus, we developed Robotic Assay for
              Drought (RoAD) to perform BR and drought response experiments in
              soil-grown Arabidopsis plants. RoAD is equipped with a bench
              scale, a precisely controlled watering system, an RGB camera, and
              a laser profilometer. It performs daily weighing, watering, and

              by watering plants with Propiconazole (PCZ), a BR biosynthesis
              inhibitor. We developed image processing algorithms for both
              plant segmentation and phenotypic trait extraction in order to
              accurately measure traits in 2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional

              show that the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) stress-inducible
              AP2/ERF transcription factor TINY inhibits BR-regulated growth
              while promoting drought responses. TINY-overexpressing plants
              have stunted growth, increased sensitivity to BR biosynthesis
              inhibitors, and compromised BR-responsive gene expression. By
              contrast, tiny tiny2 tiny3 triple mutants have increased
              BR-regulated growth and BR-responsive gene expression. TINY
              positively regulates drought responses by activating
              drought-responsive genes and promoting abscisic acid-mediated
              stomatal closure. Global gene expression studies revealed that

  abstract = "Autophagy is a conserved catabolic process in eukaryotes that
              contributes to cell survival in response to multiple stresses and
              is important for organism fitness. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the
              core machinery of autophagy is well defined, but its
              transcriptional regulation is largely unknown. The ATG8
              (autophagy-related 8) protein plays central roles in decorating
              autophagosomes and binding to specific cargo receptors to recruit
              cargo to autophagosomes. We propose that the transcriptional
              control of ATG8 genes is important during the formation of
              autophagosomes and therefore contributes to survival during
              stress. Here, we describe a yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) screen for
              transcription factors (TFs) that regulate ATG8 gene expression in
              Arabidopsis, using the promoters of 4 ATG8 genes. We identified a
              total of 225 TFs from 35 families that bind these promoters. The
              TF-ATG8 promoter interactions revealed a wide array of diverse TF
              families for different promoters, as well as enrichment for
              families of TFs that bound to specific fragments. These TFs are
              not only involved in plant developmental processes but also in
              the response to environmental stresses. TGA9 (TGACG (TGA)
              motif-binding protein 9)/AT1G08320 was confirmed as a positive
              regulator of autophagy. TGA9 overexpression activated autophagy

  abstract = "Dynamic environmental changes such as extreme temperature, water
              scarcity and high salinity affect plant growth, survival, and
              reproduction. Plants have evolved sophisticated regulatory
              mechanisms to adapt to these unfavorable conditions, many of
              which interface with plant hormone signaling pathways. Abiotic
              stresses alter the production and distribution of phytohormones
              that in turn mediate stress responses at least in part through
              hormone- and stress-responsive transcription factors. Among
              these, the APETALA2/ETHYLENE RESPONSIVE FACTOR (AP2/ERF) family
              transcription factors (AP2/ERFs) have emerged as key regulators
              of various stress responses, in which they also respond to
              hormones with improved plant survival during stress conditions.
              Apart from participation in specific stresses, AP2/ERFs are
              involved in a wide range of stress tolerance, enabling them to
              form an interconnected stress regulatory network. Additionally,
              many AP2/ERFs respond to the plant hormones abscisic acid (ABA)
              and ethylene (ET) to help activate ABA and ET dependent and
              independent stress-responsive genes. While some AP2/ERFs are
              implicated in growth and developmental processes mediated by
              gibberellins (GAs), cytokinins (CTK), and brassinosteroids (BRs).
              The involvement of AP2/ERFs in hormone signaling adds the
              complexity of stress regulatory network. In this review, we
              summarize recent studies on AP2/ERF transcription factors in
              hormonal and abiotic stress responses with an emphasis on
              selected family members in Arabidopsis. In addition, we leverage
              publically available Arabidopsis gene networks and transcriptome
              data to investigate AP2/ERF regulatory networks, providing
              context and important clues about the roles of diverse AP2/ERFs

              membranes. Previous studies have revealed that the green and
              white sectors develop into sources (green tissues) and sinks
              (white tissues) early in leaf development. In this report we
              focus on white sectors, and show that their transformation into
              effective sinks involves a sharp reduction in plastid number and
              size. Despite these reductions, cells in the white sectors have
              near-normal amounts of plastid RNA and protein, and surprisingly,
              a marked amplification of chloroplast DNA. The maintenance of
              protein synthesis capacity in the white sectors might poise
              plastids for their development into other plastid types. The
              green and white im sectors have different cell wall compositions:
              whereas cell walls in the green sectors resemble those in wild
              type, cell walls in the white sectors have reduced lignin and
              cellulose microfibrils, as well as alterations in galactomannans
              and the decoration of xyloglucan. These changes promote
              susceptibility to the pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. Enhanced
              susceptibility can also be explained by repressed expression of
              some, but not all, defense genes. We suggest that differences in
              morphology, physiology and biochemistry between the green and
              white sectors is caused by a reprogramming of leaf development
              that is coordinated, in part, by mechanisms of retrograde
              (plastid-to-nucleus) signaling, perhaps mediated by ROS. We
              conclude that variegation mutants offer a novel system to study

              COR utilizes the transcription factor MYC2, a master regulator of

              functions to inhibit accumulation of salicylic acid (SA) and thus

              addition, the function of the core transcription factor in the BR

              family transcription factors. Besides the role in promoting
              growth, BRs are also implicated in plant responses to drought
              stress. However, the molecular mechanisms by which BRs regulate
              drought response have just begun to be revealed. The functions of
              WRKY transcription factors in BR-regulated plant growth have not
              been established, although their roles in stress responses are
              well documented. Here, we found that three Arabidopsis thaliana
              group III WRKY transcription factors, WRKY46, WRKY54, and WRKY70,
              are involved in both BR-regulated plant growth and drought
              response as the wrky46 wrky54 wrky70 triple mutant has defects in
              BR-regulated growth and is more tolerant to drought stress.
              RNA-sequencing analysis revealed global roles of WRKY46, WRKY54,
              and WRKY70 in promoting BR-mediated gene expression and
              inhibiting drought responsive genes. WRKY54 directly interacts
              with BES1 to cooperatively regulate the expression of target
              genes. In addition, WRKY54 is phosphorylated and destabilized by
              GSK3-like kinase BR-INSENSITIVE2, a negative regulator in the BR
              pathway. Our results therefore establish WRKY46/54/70 as
              important signaling components that are positively involved in
              BR-regulated growth and negatively involved in drought responses.",

              brassinosteroid (BR) pathway that promotes plant growth. Here, we
              show that BES1 interacts with the ubiquitin receptor protein DSK2
              and is targeted to the autophagy pathway during stress via the
              interaction of DSK2 with ATG8, a ubiquitin-like protein directing
              autophagosome formation and cargo recruitment. Additionally, DSK2
              is phosphorylated by the GSK3-like kinase BIN2, a negative
              regulator in the BR pathway. BIN2 phosphorylation of DSK2
              flanking its ATG8 interacting motifs (AIMs) promotes DSK2-ATG8
              interaction, thereby targeting BES1 for degradation. Accordingly,
              loss-of-function dsk2 mutants accumulate BES1, have altered

  abstract = "Plants are faced with a barrage of stresses in their environment
              and must constantly balance their growth and survival. As such,
              plants have evolved complex control systems that perceive and
              respond to external and internal stimuli in order to optimize
              these responses, many of which are mediated by signaling
              molecules such as phytohormones. One such class of molecules
              called Brassinosteroids (BRs) are an important group of plant
              steroid hormones involved in numerous aspects of plant life
              including growth, development and response to various stresses.
              The molecular determinants of the BR signaling pathway have been
              extensively defined, starting with the membrane-localized
              receptor BRI1 and co-receptor BAK1 and ultimately culminating in
              the activation of BES1/BZR1 family transcription factors, which
              direct a transcriptional network controlling the expression of
              thousands of genes enabling BRs to influence growth and stress
              programs. Here, we highlight recent progress in understanding the
              relationship between the BR pathway and plant stress responses
