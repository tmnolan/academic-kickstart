 abstract = {The immutans (im) variegation mutant of Arabidopsis has green and
white-sectored leaves due to the absence of fully functional
plastid terminal oxidase (PTOX), a plastoquinol oxidase in
thylakoid membranes. PTOX appears to be at the nexus of a growing
number of biochemical pathways in the plastid, including
carotenoid biosynthesis, PSI cyclic electron flow, and
chlororespiration. During the early steps of chloroplast
biogenesis, PTOX serves as an alternate electron sink and is a
prime determinant of the redox poise of the developing
photosynthetic apparatus. Whereas a lack of PTOX causes the
formation of photooxidized plastids in the white sectors of im,
compensating mechanisms allow the green sectors to escape the
effects of the mutation. This manuscript provides an update on
PTOX, the mechanism of im variegation, and findings about im
compensatory mechanisms.},
